# Kontakty Contacts Database Manipulator  
## by Peter Martinson  

This is a *very* basic contacts database interface, which uses PHP to access a MySQL database.  The user begins at `index.php`, and must either sign up or log in with a username and a password.  The user then has the ability to view his/her contact list, search for contacts with specific information, modify contacts, and create new contacts.  The user can then log off and continue normal life.  

Note: _Kontakty_ is Russian for _contacts_.
